# Swift Version

Built with Swift 5.1. We assume you have already registered for a user. Login.

### How this works

Once you're logged in, the iOS thing will ping the server every second. This is to replicate some user usages such as an expired access token upon request during an infinite scroll or simply having an expired refresh token.

If you change your password in the admin view, then you will be redirected to the LoginViewController.
